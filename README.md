# Project Title

Northcoders-News

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

1.  Run `npm i` in the terminal
2.  install mongodb - instructions can be found here https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ (make sure you follow the right set for your OS)

## Installing

1.  Fork this repo to your own gitHub account
2.  Clone this repo to your machine (run `git clone (url of your fork)` in your terminal
3.  to test installation, open two terminal windows. in the first, run `mongod` in the second, run `npm seed:dev`. This will seed your dev database. (`don't forget the dependencies above`)

## Running the tests

tests can be run by running `npm t` in your terminal

Tests confirm that all routes function properly, as well as testing error-handling middleware for client-side errors.
